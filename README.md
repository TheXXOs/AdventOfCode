# (The)XXOs' Advent Of Code Answer Database

This is a repository for all of my Advent of Code solutions!

Avoid this repository if you want to do it yourself and don't want to know the solutions. Please *don't* use this repository to get answers if you can figure it out by yourself.

Check out [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/ "Advent of Code") by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/ "was.tl") if you want to participate, or see the questions.

I'm also writing my initial... reactions? I guess? to the questions and stuff of AoC, so check that out in the [Not-Blog-Posts folder](https://github.com/TheXXOs/AdventOfCode/tree/main/My%20Solutions/2020/Not-Blog-Posts). I may eventually turn it into a website or something.

**Please Note:**
If you wish to *use* these, the input is put in a file of the name `input.txt`.
