# (The)XXOs' Advent Of Code Answer Database

This is a repository for all of my Advent of Code solutions!

Avoid this repository if you want to do it yourself and don't want to know the solutions. Please *don't* use this repository to get answers if you can figure it out by yourself.

Check out [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/ "Advent of Code") by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/ "was.tl") if you want to participate, or see the questions.

In 2020 I wrote my initial... reactions? I guess? to the questions and challenges of AoC, so check that out in the [Not-Blog-Posts folder](https://github.com/TheXXOs/AdventOfCode/tree/main/My%20Solutions/2020/Not-Blog-Posts) if you want.

**Please Note:**
My 2020 and 2021-post-day-3 code uses files of the name `input.txt` for the inputs, whereas days 1 & 2 of 2021 use the `inp` variable in the actual code.

```
        .---_
       / / /\|
     / / | \ *
    /  /  \ \
   / /  / \  \
 ./~~~~~~~~~~~\.
( .",^. -". '.~ )
 '~~~~~~~~~~~~~'
```
