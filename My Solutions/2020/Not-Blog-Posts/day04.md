# AoC Day 4 2020 - Late Start II
I was... late again (because of the same reason as yesterday).

However, like yesterday, I didn't lose my position on any of the private leaderboards I'm on! Nice!

## Explanation of the Challenge
The input I received is [here](https://github.com/TheXXOs/AdventOfCode/blob/main/My%20Solutions/2020/Day%204/input.txt).

### [Part One](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4)
Part One had you analyse a specific set of sets of key:value pairs, and you had to tally the number of set-of-sets which had all of the appropriate key-value pairs.

(`byr`, `iyr`, `eyr`, `hgt`, `hcl`, `ecl`, `pid`, `cid`)

There was one exception - `cid` was optional (and you had to read the question thoroughly to get that!)

You can see my code [here](https://github.com/TheXXOs/AdventOfCode/blob/main/My%20Solutions/2020/Day%204/4a.py), and my answer was `182`.

### [Part Two](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/4#part2)
Part Two built on Part One, and without going too much in depth (there's a *lot* of criteria), you had to count the number of set-of-sets that had every key necessary *but also the values had to follow specific criteria*.

You can see the criteria if you finish Part One, I'm too lazy to put it here.

`cid` was still optional.

You can see my code [here](https://github.com/TheXXOs/AdventOfCode/blob/main/My%20Solutions/2020/Day%204/4b.py), and my answer was `109`.
