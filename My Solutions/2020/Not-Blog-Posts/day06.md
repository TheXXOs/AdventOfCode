# AoC Day 6 2020 - Less than or equal to 1000
Today, I was late by... maybe a few seconds(?) because I was playing Minecraft and I only realised the time one minute before the challenge started.

Thankfully, since last time I was late, I've created [a python script](https://gist.github.com/TheXXOs/f5be15ed42c8fec59327cdc022907f44) to create files for me!

AND, on top of that... well, maybe check out the [leaderboards](https://github.com/TheXXOs/AdventOfCode/blob/main/My%20Solutions/2020/Not-Blog-Posts/day06.md#positions-on-leaderboards) section.

## Explanation of the Challenge
The input I received is [here](https://github.com/TheXXOs/AdventOfCode/blob/main/My%20Solutions/2020/Day%206/input.txt).

### [Part One](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/6)
Part One's challenge was to, from a list of "groups" (spanning multiple lines, with a double-linebreak between groups), in each group count how many *different* letters (a-z) there were,
and tally the total (in all groups) up.

Once again, I don't think I've explained it too well. Go see the actual explanation.

You can see my code [here](https://github.com/TheXXOs/AdventOfCode/blob/main/My%20Solutions/2020/Day%206/6a.py), and my answer was `6768`.

### [Part Two](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/6#part2)
Part Two was the same as Part One, except you had to find how many letters were in *all* lines in a group, as opposed to *at least one*.

Actually, just go see the explanation.

You can see my code [here](https://github.com/TheXXOs/AdventOfCode/blob/main/My%20Solutions/2020/Day%206/6b.py), and my answer was `3489`.

## Positions on leaderboards
