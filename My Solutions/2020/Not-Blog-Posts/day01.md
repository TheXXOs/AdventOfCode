# AoC Day 1 2020 - System Overload?
Today's challenge didn't go as planned...

This is mostly because of [the issue that happened with AoC's servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k4ejjz/2020_day_1_unlock_crash_postmortem/).

(No, seriously - it through out [errors 502, 503 *and* 504 errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#5xx_server_errors).

But, apart from that, the challenge wasn't too bad, actually!

I *do* want to try to have some stuff set up before the challenge starts next time, so that's something to think about.

(Oh also, because of the crash, [all points for Day 1 will be taken away](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k4ejjz/2020_day_1_unlock_crash_postmortem/)).

## Explanation of the Challenge
The input I received is [here]("../Day 1/input.txt")

### [Part One](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)
Part One of today's challenge involved finding two numbers in a long list that added to 2020 - and output their product.

(That's it.)

You can see my code [here]("../Day 1/1a.py"), and my answer was `913824`.

### [Part Two](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1#part2)
Part Two was exactly the same as Part One, except you had to do it with *three* numbers instead of two.

You can see my code [here]("../Day 1/1b.py"), and my answer was `240889536`.
